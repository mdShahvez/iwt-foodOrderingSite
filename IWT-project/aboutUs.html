                 <h2>Who are we:-</h2>
                 <p>Launched in Chandigarh Chitkara University 12 years ago, <b>Funday Food's</b> has grown from a home project to one of the largest food aggregators in the world.    We are present in 24 countries and 10000+ cities globally, enabling our vision of better food for more people. We not only connect people to food in every          context but work closely with restaurants to enable a sustainable ecosystem.</p>
                 <h2>Our goal is to change what you eat:-</h2>
                 <h3>Improving Quality of Food</h3>
                 <p>We are committed to nurturing a neutral platform and are helping food establishments maintain high standards through Hyperpure. Food Hygiene Ratings is a coveted mark of quality among our restaurant partners</p>
                 <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                 <p>Back in 2008, all it took was an idea to enable digital access to thousands of restaurant menus. Three passionate foodies who hated waiting in lines, drove around Delhi to collect menus from restaurants, scan them and put them online. Their idea has now grown into the vision that drives our team of 5000+ people everyday.</p>
